## **Quality Planning**

1. Quality of Design

- The Design of the Web App must satisfy all of the features that the users need including:
  - Author Interface:
    - Create Books, organizing books in chapters
    - Edit Books
  - User Interface:
    - Book selection
    - Font and size of text alteration
    - Copy texts function
    - Table of contents for the ease of book traversal
    - Bookmarks and bookmarks traversal

1. Quality of Conformance

- During the Project Construction phase, the design specifications must be followed including:
  - The technologies proposed during the Planning Phase
  - The aspects and functions proposed during the Planning Phase

C.Quality Control

- For controlling the quality of the project, reviews and tests are used throughout the Project Construction phase to check for flaws and inconsistency

## **Risk Management**

1. Risk identification

Project Risks:

- Schedule Slippage: because there are limitation in time and knowledge about technology, team may delay the plan of the project.

- Poorly designed schedule: The team focus too much on optional features, and can not appropriately respond to the required ones.

Technical Risks:

- There may be bugs and errors in the program that the developers are not acknowledged (due to lack of sufficient knowledge)

- There are some optional features that developers want to add to the program, but it may require a lot of changes or to redesign the application

- There are unnecessary web browsers, fonts or devices to support

1. Risk control

Project Risks:

- Schedule Slippage: Spend the first week to learn all the technology that we will use in the program to reduce the slippage risk.

- Plan to complete all the standard features first, then add optional features if time is not a concern.

Technical Risks

- Devise a plan to test for hidden errors and bugs before rolling out the application

- Plan for all additional features, design the code to add more features easily

- Make the program supporting only for modern and common web browsers, fonts or devices
